Hi there üëã 

üíª I'm interested in working with Rust to build operating systems, distributed databases and network programming.
- Currently tinkering with network programming concepts by building [scs](https://github.com/Onboardbase/secure-share) using Rust.
- I also build/work on proxy databases for SQL like applications to be able to utilize the Postgres Wire Protocol. (It will be open sourced soon).

üç∫ I am open to internships opportunities in the fields mentioned above.
